## Overview
GamerHub is a gaming platform that brings together web2 and web3 games in one place. It allows gamers to access and play a wide range of games, metaverses, guilds, and NFTs. With a focus on ownership and profitability, GamerHub enables players to earn rewards while playing games. It provides a user-friendly interface with features like user and game dashboards, gamer profiles, and subscription systems. GamerHub aims to create a seamless and immersive gaming experience for gamers of all kinds. The platform can be accessed through the web, a mobile application or a PC launcher with flexible subscrition plans for users with multiple devices.

## Features

- Intuitive AI model deployment UI
- Customizable node configuration
- Private decentralized infrastructure
- Scheduled model training

## Hackathon
For the hackthon, we built the MVP for GamerHub. this includes the website, landing pages, wallet connection using particle network,sign-up and sign-in systems, subscription systems, user dashboard, game dashboard, user profile and user reward systems. We also worked on the Pitch deck, Tokenomics, Go-to-market strategy, product pricing, token economy/usecase, market size/oppourtuity, competitive analysis and advantage among others.

### Website
- A visually appealing landing page that introduces the DeCenter project and its value proposition.
- Briefly explains the benefits of decentralized AI model training and its impact on reducing time and costs.
